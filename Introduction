This is our CS225 group C6 computing assignment 1

In this programming assignment, we implement a registration, queueing and reporting system for mass medical treatments. 

For the registration, we will get a person's ID, name, profession, age, risk status, contact detail(address, phone, wechat, email)
The patients can write them into an input file and then we will read the file to create a person node for each patient

For the queueing, we will process according to the specific priority.

We will build a local queue, which is realized by linked lists, to transfer the patients registing today or at ddl to Fibonacci heap.
We will also store all the person node to a database to protect all information

For the central queue, which is a fibonacci heap, we will generate 4 heaps.
fib_heap is for normal people, priority_heap is for those with priority letters,
waiting_heap is for medium-risk people and withdraw, high_risk_heap is for high-risk people
We will pop the patients according to their prioirty to let them get treated

For the report, the system will produce weekly report and monthly report.
The reported people are arranged by their age.
We will report the list that peopcole have been treated, the list that people have queueing, and The list that people is registered with a appointentment

The whole system will end at day 30.
